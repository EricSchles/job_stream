for collecting some timing info.  98% confidence with 5% error is the standard.

Note!  Any gains < 10% with a 5% confidence interval means that they're not certain.

Note that those are only 0.23, or about 5% apart.  Since the 5% error in the average could go either way, these are highly similar, and these may have about the same runtime.
